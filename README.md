# Green Lion Racing Database

> [!NOTE]
> This project is now archived, it was a nice idea to improve the management of the team, but it has some flaws, data is visibile to everyone, no permission management, pretty much not used for its purpose, also because user-friendlyness is bad, MacOS/Mobile support is miserable/not existent. And I hate sqlite. :)  
> A better idea would be using a web accessable page, with all these issues resolved.
